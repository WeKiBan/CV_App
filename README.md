### Built with

- HTML/SCSS
- CSS Grid
- Javascript
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library.
- React Hooks


### What I learned

My first Real React project showed me just how beneficial JavaScript frameworks are for keeping your projects much more manageable and organized. The ability to build HTML elements within the javascript file using JSX Is very intuitive and it's easy to see why being able to break projects down into reusable components is beneficial for developers.

I believe this project has given me a solid grasp of React Hooks and the React framework in general, and I am looking forward to using it in the future to build more complex projects.
